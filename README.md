# Foatier App

Foatier App is a modern web application designed to orders management.

## Features

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Managing Orders and Products

- **Products:** Admins/managers can create, update, view, and delete products (name, price, description, inventory).
- **Orders:** Customers place orders for products. Orders have statuses (pending, shipped, completed). Admins/managers can view and manage orders.

### 2. Authentication

- Users must log in to access protected features.
- Supports email/password login (can be extended for OAuth/social logins).

### 3. Roles and Permissions

- **Roles:** Admin, Manager, Customer.
- **Permissions:**
  - **Admin:** Full access (manage products, orders, users).
  - **Manager:** Manage products and orders.
  - **Customer:** View products, place orders, view own order history.

### Example Workflow

1. **Admin logs in:** Add products, view/manage orders, assign roles.
2. **Customer logs in:** Browse products, place orders, view order history.
3. **Manager logs in:** Update product info, process orders.

### Implementation Notes

- Permissions enforced in both backend (Laravel) and frontend (React).
- Validate user input and check authentication before sensitive actions.
- Use Laravel policies/gates or Spatie Laravel-Permission for roles/permissions.
- Use protected routes/components in React.
